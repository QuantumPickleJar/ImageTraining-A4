  <li>Try training the neural network by clicking the run button (top left).</li>
  <li>Try replacing the tanh activation function with the reLU function and train the
          network again.</li>
  <li>Modify the network architecture to have just one hidden layer with three neurons.</br>
         Train it multiple times (to reset the network weights, click the reset button).</li>
  <li>Remove one neuron to keep just two. Retrain the network.</li>
  <li>Set the number of neurons to eight and train the network several times.</li>

Load data with <code>keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()</code>
